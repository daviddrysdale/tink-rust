//! Streaming authenticated encryption with associated data.

/// `StreamingAead` is an interface for streaming authenticated encryption with associated data.
///
/// Streaming encryption is typically used for encrypting large plaintexts such as large files.
/// Tink may eventually contain multiple interfaces for streaming encryption depending on the
/// supported properties. This interface supports a streaming interface for symmetric encryption
/// with authentication. The underlying encryption modes are selected so that partial plaintext can
/// be obtained fast by decrypting and authenticating just a part of the ciphertext.
///
/// Instances of `StreamingAead` must follow the OAE2 definition as proposed in the paper "Online
/// Authenticated-Encryption and its Nonce-Reuse Misuse-Resistance" by [Hoang, Reyhanitabar, Rogaway
/// and Viz√°r](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/189.pdf)
pub trait StreamingAead {

    /// via the wrapper results in AEAD-encryption of the written data, using `aad`
    /// as associated authenticated data. The associated data is not included in the ciphertext
    /// and has to be passed in as parameter for decryption.
