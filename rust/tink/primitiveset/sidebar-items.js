Users will usually work with primitive instances, which essentially wrap primitive sets. For example an instance of an AEAD-primitive for a given keyset holds a set of AEAD-primitives corresponding to the keys in the keyset, and uses the set members to do the actual crypto operations: to encrypt data the primary AEAD-primitive from the set is used, and upon decryption the ciphertext's prefix determines the id of the primitive from the set."],["TypedEntry","`TypedEntry` represents a single entry in a keyset for primitives of a known type.
